# [Forever Engine](https://github.com/Yoshubs/FunkinForever)
An open-source [Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) mod engine
----------------------------------------------
Forever Engine is an open source modification of the Friday Night Funkin' engine. Forever Engine is not to be confused with its original name, FUNKIN FOREVER, which is now no longer the name of the engine. The reason this is important will have to do with future plans of ours, so stay tuned if you'd like to hear more about those ;)
----------------------------------------------
The Forever Engine is based off of the aforementioned [Friday Night Funkin' Source](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin). It's made to be more accessible and easier to build off of, as well as having a lot of quality of life changes and a much more focused direction on the more traditional feel of rhythm games, all while still keeping the same style and feel of Friday Night Funkin'. I know a lot of source codes are hard to work with for friday night funkin', usually very unoptimised or very unorganised, I wanted to fix both of these issues with Forever Engine and Funkin' Forever in the future. True to the spirit of [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com), Friday Night Funkin' should be accessible by everyone, both modders and gamers alike, and I wanted to make it my goal to fix a lot of the issues that prevented people from being able to use the base game's engine, as well as create a more polished engines, as I was unhappy with the current existing ones at the time.

----------------------------------------------
CHANGELOG UNMARKED HOTFIX
* Removes leftover tankman assets, the game will still load them if provided with the sprites but will no longer come with the week 7 songs or sprites, both out of respect for newgrounds and compliance of gamebanana modding rules (that I had no idea existed lmao)
* fixed some misc stuff, like the game refusing to compile, bugs with loading note stuffs (I'm working on an improved note map system, stay tuned, you'll be able to do some powerful shit with it and it'll be really easy to edit!)

CHANGELOG v0.2.1
* custom controls lmao
* fixed some misc bugs and glitches

  * 0.2.1.1 fixes a stupid oversight
  * 0.2.1.2 fixes html5 and accuracy

CHANGELOG v0.2.0
* removed most week 7 stuffs because I respect newgrounds and they werent meant to be in for the release I just wanted to test
* options menu, main menu, title screen, story menu, freeplay menu
* custom color coding freeplay menu based on weeks! (or songs)
* week 7 icon formatting
* week 7 offset formatting (offset editor coming soon)
* no changes to the chart editor (don't use it yet its still very buggy and limited)
* some stuff got overhauled
* note timings and better ratings

How to Compile:

Basically, all of the files you need are in the engine itself through the setup.bat (Huge thanks to [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798) for the download to the file) except for Visual Studio Code, or whatever program you choose to use to program in the engine. If you've already worked with fnf, this should work perfectly with you and if it doesn't then you might have the wrong target settings, or Lime is probably broken, that's usually what happens with these things, it's happened to me a ton of times lmao. I'm not a very good programmer.
If you want some external sources that will better walk you through how to compile the game, look no further than the [base game github](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) and [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798), I really hope they help you out!

----------------------------------------------
Thank you for checking out my engine! Got any questions? DM me at Shubs#0404 on Discord!
I'm **really** scared this will become obsolete when week 7 source comes out lmao so I'm gonna make it more classic rhythm game oriented in the future, as well as mod friendly, much like the base game, but much more hopefully!
