# FunkinForever
An open-source [Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) mod engine
----------------------------------------------
Funkin' Forever, or Forever Engine is an open source modification of the Friday Night Funkin' engine. At the time of writing this, it is completely and absolutely UNFINISHED, and I do not recommend anyone uses it for the time being. The plan is to have a more easy to mod and heavily documented Friday Night Funkin' engine that I can personally use for my own projects, but others could use too if they really want (even though bigger and more community engrained engines exist lol).

----------------------------------------------
This Engine is mostly a restructure but also in a lot of ways a rewrite of the base Funkin engine that you can find [here](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin).

Planned Features:
* New Charting System
* Offset Editor based on .txt files
* Downscroll, options, etc
* Translations (if enough support is given)
* Adjustable Note Colors
* Misc Rhythm Game features
  * Offsets (maybe)
  * Note colors based on Rhythm
  * Modcharts
  * Better Score and Ratings
  * Other general features that will make this engine stand out from others
* Modularity (? idk it sounds cool and smart [not like me lmao])

Current Features:
* TANKMAN
  * Disclaimer: Tankman is not at all the main focus of this engine, please support friday night funkin on [newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) if you actually want to play week 7, this is just here for the sake of preparations for when week 7 source comes out.
* Makeshift song editor that's just the base game one
* A much more organised PlayState
* comments that are kind of funny
* idk im struggling to come up with features
* seriously this is very work in progress please understand
* separated hardcoded chart information (some of it at least
* DID I MENTION TANKMAN???
* probably a better input system idk???

How to Compile:

Basically, all of the files you need are in the engine itself through the setup.bat (Huge thanks to [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798) for the download to the file) except for Visual Studio Code, or whatever program you choose to use to program in the engine. If you've already worked with fnf, this should work perfectly with you and if it doesn't then you might have the wrong target settings, or Lime is probably broken, that's usually what happens with these things, it's happened to me a ton of times lmao. I'm not a very good programmer.
If you want some external sources that will better walk you through how to compile the game, look no further than the [base game github](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) and [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798), I really hope they help you out!

Thank you for checking out my engine! Got any questions? DM me at Shubs#0404 on Discord!
I'm **really** scared this will become obsolete when week 7 source comes out lmao so I'm gonna make it more classic rhythm game oriented in the future, as well as mod friendly, much like the base game, but much more hopefully!
