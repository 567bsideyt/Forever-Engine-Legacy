# FunkinForever
An open-source [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) mod engine
----------------------------------------------
Funkin' Forever, or Forever Engine is an open source modification of the Friday Night Funkin' engine. At the time of writing this, it is completely and absolutely 
Planned Features:

 * Options Menu, with downscroll toggle, consistent arrow toggle, enemy strum toggle (even though it shouldn't really be toggled tbh)
  
 * More Modular Systems (being able to load characters all externally, offset editors in game that generate offset maps [txt files], etc, etc)
  
 * Less clutter within the states and code (not really a feature but we just gonna roll with it)
  
 * Implementing all of the newer features once they come out
  
 * Modcharts(??? MAYBE if scarlett can help me out)
  
 * Better Editor (hopefully with the help of both codist and pixl cus pixl knows how rhythm games should work)
  
 * Better Score, Combos, etc (I mean, there's not a lot I could make about them thats better but it sounds cooler)
 
 * Language Support (HUGE MAYBE but I think it'd be cool to have translations of the game lol)
 
 * Custom Week(s) to show off engine capabilities
 
 * Custom note data (play specific animation, separation from notetypes)
 
 * Rhythm game modes (like the note colors from DDR and such)
 
 * In-Game converters??? (maybe, dunno if they'd be suuper useful)
  
Current Features:
  
  * Autoplay
  
  * Basic Controls and a somewhat improved input system?
  
  * Tankman
  
  * Separated Stages from Songs (HUGE work in progress)
  
  * Offset loading from txt files (its literally just a reverse engineer from week 7 lmao)
  
  * Abstraction and better separation of game contents in source code
  * MAYBE less ram usage? I hope so
  
Got any questions? Lemme know at Shubs#0404 on discord. Thanks for checking my project out.
I'm really scared this will become obsolete when week 7 source comes out lmao so I'm gonna make it more classic rhythm game oriented in the future, as well as mod
